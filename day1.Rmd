## R as a calculator

### R as a basic calculator
We can use R as a calculator, for example,
```{r}
2+3
```

### R as an advance calculator 
We can use R as an advance calculator, for example,
```{r}
2*sin(2*pi)
```

## R is a graphical 
We can plot a function in R easily
```{r}
curve(expr = sin, from = -10, to = 10)
curve(expr = dnorm, from = -5, to = 5)
polymroy = function(x) {
  y = 2*x + 5
  return(y)
}
curve(expr = polymroy, from = -10, to = 10)
poumitroy = function(x, a, b) {
  y = a*x + b
  return(y)
}
curve(expr = poumitroy(x, a = 1, b = 1), from = -10, to = 10, col = 1)
curve(expr = poumitroy(x, a = 2, b = 0.5), add = TRUE, col = 2)
```
